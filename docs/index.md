<!-- summary: Metadata configuration # subtitle -->

**AgentEvolver** is an end-to-end, self-evolving training framework that empowers agents to autonomously
improve their capabilities, aiming for efficient, cost-effective, and continuous capability evolution.

### ✨ Key Features

- **Self-Evolving Mechanisms**  
  ① **Automatic Task Generation** – Curiosity-driven *self-questioning* to probe the environment and autonomously create diverse tasks, eliminating costly manual dataset construction.  
  ② **Experience-guided Exploration** – *Self-navigating* strategies that summarize and reuse cross-task experience to guide higher-quality rollouts and improve exploration efficiency.  
  ③ **Attribution-based Credit Assignment** – *Self-attributing* along long trajectories to uncover the causal contribution of intermediate steps, enabling fine-grained and efficient policy optimization.  

- **Developer-Oriented Design**  
  ① **Environment Compatibility** – Standardized interfaces for seamless integration with a wide range of external environments and tool APIs.  
  ② **Flexible Context Manager** – Built-in utilities for managing multi-turn contexts and complex interaction logic, supporting diverse deployment scenarios.  
  ③ **Modular & Extensible Architecture** – Decoupled components allow easy customization, secondary development, and future algorithm upgrades.
