To evolve an agent in a data-driven manner within your own environment, the first step is to collect training data that maps the agent's abilities to your requirements.

Task Manager provides the training data for AgentEvolver. It is responsible for:

- Exploring unknown environments and profiling potential tasks,  
- Discovering new synthetic tasks and capturing user requirements,  
- Curating training tasks and managing their quality and quantity,  
- Providing a built-in synthetic reward mechanism as a fallback.  

In this section, we introduce Task Manager and explain how to efficiently collect appropriate training data for agent training, including the configuration of Environment Profiling, Task Derivation, and Task Curation strategies.

## Collect Your First Training Data

To collect your training data, perform the following four steps:

1. Integrate your environment with Environment Service (as described in the previous section).  
2. Profile the environment.  
3. Configure the strategies to be applied, including their parameters.  
4. Execute Task Manager and collect the training data.  

### 1. Adopt the Environment

Assume the environment has already been integrated with Environment Service. If not, please refer to the previous section for setup instructions.

### 2. Profile the Environment

Task Manager requires not only the API specifications but also conceptual knowledge of the environment. For example, in a file system, APIs define file operations, but they do not capture high-level concepts such as file types or formats. These conceptual elements must be explicitly represented.

We introduce the **Environment Profile** to capture these concepts. An Environment Profile is a JSON file that specifies *Entity*, *Attribute*, and *Operation* definitions for the environment.

- **Entity**: Represents a core object in the environment. Entities are the targets of interaction and can typically be created, modified, or deleted.  
- **Attribute**: Defines descriptive properties or metadata of an entity. Attributes provide contextual information but are not executable actions.  
- **Operation**: Specifies the actions that can be performed on an entity. Operations represent the functional capabilities of the environment and are often aligned with API calls.  

Additionally, the Environment Profile defines **task preferences**, which control the style and scope of the generated tasks.

A basic Environment Profile example is shown below:

```json
{
  "name": "Alice",
  "background": "A general user working with a file system.",
  "entities": [
    {
      "name": "file",
      "description": "A file in a file system.",
      "attrs": {
        "name": "The name of the file.",
        "size": "The size of the file in bytes.",
        "type": "The type of the file, e.g. text, image, video, etc.",
        "parent": "The parent directory of the file."
      },
      "opts": [
        { "name": "create", "description": "Create a new file." },
        { "name": "delete", "description": "Delete a file." },
        { "name": "read", "description": "Read a file." },
        { "name": "write", "description": "Write to a file." }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "directory",
      "description": "A directory in a file system.",
      "attrs": {
        "name": "The name of the directory.",
        "parent": "The parent directory of the directory."
      },
      "opts": [
        { "name": "create", "description": "Create a new directory." },
        { "name": "delete", "description": "Delete a directory." },
        { "name": "list", "description": "List the contents of a directory." }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "task_preference": {
    "num_entities": 2,
    "num_opts": 3,
    "relation_difficulty": 3
  }
}
```

In this profile, entities `file` and `directory` are defined with attributes (`name`, `size`, `type`, `parent`) and operations (`create`, `delete`, `read`, `write`, `list`). Based on these definitions, Task Manager gains a structured understanding of the environment to support task derivation and curation.

To create your own Environment Profile, copy the template `environment_profile_template.json` to `environment_profile.json` and fill in the details. Using an LLM to assist in drafting the profile can reduce manual effort.

### 3. Configure the Strategies

Transforming profiles into synthetic tasks involves two stages: **task derivation** and **task curation**.

**Task derivation** is the process of generating candidate tasks from the profile. During derivation, exploration and summarization are performed under the guidance of a chosen strategy. Strategies determine how the environment is traversed and how structured tasks are extracted from exploration trajectories.

**Task curation** ensures task quality and diversity. Filters are applied to discard infeasible, redundant, or irrelevant tasks. Mixture strategies combine tasks from multiple sources and control properties such as difficulty distribution.

By default, Task Manager provides:

* *RandomWalk Strategy* for task derivation,
* *DeduplicationFilter*, *FeasibilityFilter*, and *UnifiedMixtureStrategy* for task curation.

These can be configured in the YAML configuration file:

```yaml
# TODO
# Mixture strategy is only active in integrated mode.
```

### 4. Start Task Synthesis

Once configuration is complete, task synthesis can be initiated.

1. Start the Environment Service.
2. Start Task Manager.

#### Standalone Mode

Task Manager can be executed in standalone mode for simple task synthesis.

Example command:

```bash
# TODO
```

The synthesis progress will be displayed. When the process completes, the path to the generated tasks will be printed.

#### Integrated Mode

In most workflows, Task Manager is integrated with AgentEvolver. Launching AgentEvolver automatically starts the training and task synthesis pipeline.

!!! info "Standalone vs Integrated"
    Task Manager can be executed independently for lightweight data generation. It is recommended to tune strategies in standalone mode, and then use integrated mode in production, where additional features are available within AgentEvolver.

### 5. Check the Data

The generated synthetic tasks are stored in:

```text
# TODO
```

Inspect the generated data to ensure it aligns with your training requirements.

## Overview of Task Manager

In data-driven model optimization, agent training is formulated as trajectory tuning over environment-specific tasks. Consequently, the quality of training data directly determines the resulting agent capabilities. However, in real environments, acquiring and controlling the quality of training tasks is inherently difficult.

Task Manager addresses this challenge by providing a dynamic and general-purpose workflow for environment exploration, task generation, and quality control.

```

The following sections describe each component of Task Manager in detail, including extension points for customization.

## Environment Profiling

An Environment Profile describes the concepts of an environment using **entities**, **attributes**, and **operations**. Similar to object-oriented programming and database schemas, these components are considered fundamental.

* **Entity**: Represents an object in the environment.
* **Attributes**: Define the properties of the entity.
* **Operations**: Specify the actions that can be applied to the entity.

For example:

```
Entity: File
Attributes
    - name: The name of the file.
    - size: The size of the file in bytes.
    - type: The type of the file, e.g. text, image, video, etc.
    - permission: The permission of the file.
Operations
    - create: Create a new file.
    - delete: Delete a file.
    - read: Read a file.
    - write: Write to a file.
    - chmod: Change the permission of a file.
```

The granularity of a profile is flexible. With the assistance of LLMs, profiles can be constructed at multiple levels, ranging from a single generic entity to highly specialized entities. The choice of granularity is a trade-off between manual specification and the capability of the LLM to generalize.

Task Manager leverages the Environment Profile to recognize concepts, explore relationships between entities, and synthesize meaningful tasks. Operations are combined to form candidate solutions reflecting real-world problem-solving.

Users may optionally specify a **User Preference** in addition to the Environment Profile. Preferences define expectations for the agent's capabilities, such as desired task difficulty or task categories.

### Write a Profile

Profiles can be specified in **JSON** (recommended) or in **Python**.

Top-level structure:

```json
{
  "name": string,
  "background": string,
  "entities": [ ... ],
  "task_preference": {
    "num_entities": integer,
    "num_opts": integer,
    "relation_difficulty": integer
  }
}
```

Example entity definition:

```json
{
  "name": "file",
  "description": "A file in a file system.",
  "attrs": {
    "name": "The name of the file."
  },
  "opts": [
    { "name": "create", "description": "Create a new file." }
  ]
}
```

A minimal working example:

```json
{
  "name": "Alice",
  "background": "A general user working with a file system.",
  "entities": [
    {
      "name": "file",
      "description": "A file in a file system.",
      "attrs": {
        "name": "The name of the file.",
        "size": "The size of the file in bytes.",
        "type": "The type of the file (e.g., text, image, video).",
        "parent": "The parent directory of the file."
      },
      "opts": [
        { "name": "create", "description": "Create a new file." },
        { "name": "delete", "description": "Delete a file." },
        { "name": "read", "description": "Read a file." },
        { "name": "write", "description": "Write to a file." }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "directory",
      "description": "A directory in a file system.",
      "attrs": {
        "name": "The name of the directory.",
        "parent": "The parent directory of the directory."
      },
      "opts": [
        { "name": "create", "description": "Create a new directory." },
        { "name": "delete", "description": "Delete a directory." },
        { "name": "list", "description": "List the contents of a directory." }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "task_preference": {
    "num_entities": 2,
    "num_opts": 3,
    "relation_difficulty": 3
  }
}
```

## Task Derivation

Task Derivation is the initial stage of synthetic task generation. It transforms the Environment Profile into preliminary task drafts by applying exploration and synthesis strategies.

The primary objectives are:

1. **Exploration** – Cover the environment systematically or stochastically.
2. **Summarization** – Convert exploration trajectories into concise, structured candidate tasks.

Available strategies:

* **RandomWalk Strategy** – Random exploration producing a diverse task set.
* Additional strategies will be introduced in future versions.

### RandomWalk Strategy

The RandomWalk Strategy is simple yet effective. It explores the environment by sampling entities and operations at random, generating diverse trajectories that can be summarized into tasks.

Parameters:

```yaml
task_manager:
  strategy: random
  strategy_args:
    max_explore_step: 30
    max_llm_retries: 6
    env_url: ${env_service.env_url}
    exploration_llm_temperature: 1.0
    exploration_llm_top_p: 1.0
    exploration_llm_top_k: 100
```

## Task Curation

Task Curation ensures the quality and diversity of tasks generated during derivation by applying filters and mixture strategies.

* **Filters**
    * *DeduplicationFilter*: Removes redundant or near-duplicate tasks.
    * *FeasibilityFilter*: Removes tasks that cannot be executed in the environment.

* **Mixture Strategies**
    * *UnifiedMixtureStrategy*: Combines tasks from multiple sources to maintain balance.

Goals of curation:

* **Quality assurance** – Ensure valid, feasible, and logically sound tasks.
* **Diversity preservation** – Avoid bias toward a single task type.
* **Dynamic control** – Adjust task selection according to agent progress.

### DeduplicationFilter

Removes duplicate or highly similar tasks to improve data diversity. Enabled by default.

### FeasibilityFilter

Filters out tasks that cannot be completed given the environment constraints.

## Synthetic Reward

Task Manager provides a built-in **synthetic reward** as a fallback, enabling training without requiring user-defined reward functions.

Key properties:

* **Generality** – Applicable across diverse environments.
* **Zero-configuration** – Works out of the box.
* **Extensibility** – Can be replaced or extended with custom reward functions.

Typical reward components:

* **Relevance check** – Whether the trajectory matches the task.
* **Success check** – Whether the task is successfully completed.
* **Efficiency check** – Whether the task is solved within reasonable steps.

> While the built-in reward is general-purpose, it is recommended to design custom rewards aligned with the application domain.

Configuration example:

```yaml
task_manager:
  grader:
    original_grader: env
    synthetic_grader: llm
```

## Extend Task Manager

Task Manager is designed as a **modular and extensible framework**, adaptable to different training scenarios.

Extension points:

* **Environment Profiling** – Define new entities, attributes, or operations, and adjust granularity.
* **Task Derivation** – Implement new exploration or synthesis strategies.
* **Task Curation** – Introduce custom filters or mixture strategies.
* **Reward Functions** – Replace or augment the default synthetic reward.
